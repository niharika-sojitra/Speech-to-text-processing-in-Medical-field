In order to provide better and faster treatment to patients, NLP methods and AI models are greatly needed in the medical field. Since during pandemic speech recognition emerge exponentially, still there isn't much work done in the field of medical text classification, which may assist hospital professionals treat patients more efficiently, we came across the speech-to-text processing issue for this project. In this study, we attempted to give patient prescriptions in the form of speech, which we subsequently converted to text using NLP text processing techniques and models, which were then used to identify the disease category. By reducing unnecessary physical contact with documentation and form completion, this approach will save doctors' time when writing extensive medical prescriptions and lessen the risk of disease spread. Multinomial DB, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN had testing accuracy of 57.88\%, 66.43\%, 69.55\%, and 65.72\%, respectively.
